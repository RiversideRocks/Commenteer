# Commenteer
Random Comments for the masses.


## What is it?

Commenteer is a collection of comments I have collected from YouTube that I have released for the public. Use them for entertainment, training AIs, whatever you want (just don't use them for bots please!).


## The Comments

These comments are random comments from random videos. The only requirement was that a comment had to be generic and could not have terminology or names related to the video. For example, a comment that said `Great video Riverside Rocks!` would not be selected, while a comment like `Great video!` would be.
